# Geocoding with Data-Flo  
Converting geographic location information, like an address, into latitude and longitude is a common hurdle for displaying data points on a map. Data-Flo simplifies this process.

# Dealing with Dates  
Data-Flo makes it easy to convert different date formats into a standard format, ensuring consistency across your dataset.

# Enhancing Our Microreact Data Dashboard with Data-Flo  
By combining Data-Flo and Microreact, you can transform a data source in Data-Flo and dynamically update a Microreact project, creating a complete and interactive data dashboard.
