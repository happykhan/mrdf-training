* **Geocoding with Data-Flo**: Converting geographic location information, like an address, into latitude and longitude is a common hurdle for displaying data points on a map. Data-Flo simplifies this process.  [Learn more about geocoding](https://dataflo-cookbook.netlify.app/geocoding-market/)
* **Dealing with Dates:** Data-Flo makes it easy to convert different date formats into a standard format, ensuring consistency across your dataset.
* **Enhancing Our Microreact Data Dashboard with Data-Flo**: By combining Data-Flo and Microreact, you can transform a data source in Data-Flo and dynamically update a Microreact project, creating a complete and interactive data dashboard.
