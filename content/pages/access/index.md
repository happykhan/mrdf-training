Each session in the **"Exploring Microreact and Data-Flo for Pathogen Genomics"** webinar series will typically run for **one hour**, offering a focused and interactive experience. The format includes an introductory presentation, a live demonstration, and a Q&A session. These webinars will be conducted via **Zoom**, providing a seamless and accessible platform for all participants.

## Connecting with Zoom

To join the webinar, all presentations will be delivered through Zoom. Zoom is a free software. Links to each session will be sent to your registered email address prior to the event. Please ensure that you have **Zoom installed and tested** on your device ahead of time to avoid any technical issues.

Here are a few steps to help you prepare:
- **Download and install Zoom**: Zoom is available for **free** on all major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) as well as mobile devices (iOS and Android).

## Accessing Microreact

Microreact is a web-based platform that allows you to visualize and share genomic data interactively. Here’s how to access it:

1. **Go to the Microreact website**:  
   Visit [microreact.org](https://microreact.org/).
   
2. **Create a free account** (optional):  
   You can start exploring without an account, but creating one will allow you to save and manage your projects.

3. **Upload your data**:  
   Use the "Create Project" button to import your dataset, such as CSV or Excel files. Microreact will guide you through visualizing your data with trees, maps, and charts. We will provide you sample data as part of the webinar.

4. **Explore your data**:  
   Once your data is uploaded, you can customize your visualizations by adding panels like heatmaps, networks, and custom charts.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the [Microreact documentation](https://docs.microreact.org/).

## Accessing Data-Flo

Data-Flo is a tool that simplifies data transformation and integrates seamlessly with Microreact. Here’s how to get started with Data-Flo:

1. **Go to the Data-Flo website**:  
   Visit [data-flo.io](https://data-flo.io/).

2. **Create a free account**:  
   You’ll need to sign up to start using Data-Flo for your data transformation needs.

3. **Upload your data**:  
   Upload raw data files like CSV or Excel, and Data-Flo will help you transform them for visualization in tools like Microreact.

4. **Transform your data**:  
   Use Data-Flo’s intuitive interface to clean, filter, and organize your data for downstream analysis or integration into Microreact.
