Join us for the "Exploring Microreact and Data-Flo for Pathogen Genomics" webinar series, hosted by [CGPS](https://www.pathogensurveillance.net/) (as part of [HPRUged](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/hpruged/)). This series will offer hands-on insights into utilizing Microreact and Data-Flo to visualize and transform pathogen genomic data. Each 1-hour session includes a 20-minute introductory presentation, a 20-minute live demonstration with sample data for participants to follow, and 10 minutes for Q&A.

Webinar Schedule:
- Oct 22: Introduction to Microreact: trees, maps, charts, and tables
- Oct 29: Building a data dashboard with Microreact
- Nov 5: Data transformation with Data-Flo
- Nov 12: Linking Data-Flo to Microreact

Sessions will be held from 14:00 - 15:00 BST/GMT.

To participant, please add your contact details and preferences in the form below. We will send the Zoom links via email closer to the date.
